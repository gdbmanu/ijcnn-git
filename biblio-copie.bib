    abstract = {{We have developed the prototype of a pure-BCI video game based on the well known vintage video game "Space Invaders". In our "Brain Invaders" a number of aliens are displayed in a grid and the player has to destroy a particular alien, the target, only by concentrating on it. The game makes use of a stateof- the art P300 oddball paradigm to select the alien to be destroyed at a regular pace, based on current probabilities assigned to each alien by a learning machine continuously analyzing and classifying the user's electroencephalographic stream (the Open-ViBE platform). As compared to the standard P300- speller paradigm our game may optionally use: 1) flashing items in random groups and no longer by rows and columns; 2) variable inter-stimulus intervals drawn from an exponential distribution; 3) magnification of flashed target items. Preliminary tests show an excellent transfer rate, since starting with 36 aliens on the screen, one to three repetitions typically suffice to destroy the target 
alien. Our development is completely open-source and will continue to improve further the signal processing and classification algorithms, besides the paradigm itself, the gameplay and the BCI ergonomy, in order to achieve a "Plug \& Play" video game suitable for the large public of gamers.}},

Multichannel signals are expanded using a local cosine basis, and the (time-frequency labelled) coefficients are modelled as multivariate random variables, whose distribution is governed by a (hidden) Markov chain. Several models are described, together with maximum likelihood estimation algorithms. The model is applied to electroencephalogram data, and it is shown that variance-covariance matrices labelled by sensor and frequency indices can yield relevant informations on the analyzed signals. This is examplified by a case study on the characterization of alpha waves desynchronization in the context of multiple sclerosis disease.}},

BCIs are communication systems that enable users to send commands to computers solely by means of brain activity. BCIs are gaining interest among the virtual reality (VR) community since they have appeared as promising interaction devices for virtual environments (VEs). The key features of the platform are (1) high modularity, (2) embedded tools for visualization and feedback based on VR and 3D displays, (3) BCI design made available to non-programmers thanks to visual programming, and (4) various tools offered to the different types of users. The platform features are illustrated in this paper with two entertaining VR applications based on a BCI. In the first one, users can move a virtual ball by imagining hand movements, while in the second one, they can control a virtual spaceship using real or imagined foot movements. Online experiments with these 
applications together with the evaluation of the platform computational performances showed its suitability for the design of VR applications controlled with a BCI. OpenViBE is a free software distributed under an open-source license.}},
